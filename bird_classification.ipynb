    "Our data source is the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset (CUB_200_2011). This dataset was the most used bird classification dataset before the newer, but larger dataset, NABirds. Therefore, we knew this dataset was still a credible and large enough source for our required data. We started our analysis by choosing 10 different bird pairs from the data, which were strategically chosen. We chose these specific birds because of their differences in color, body shape and size, beak size, leg size, and even how they sat on branches. "

    "The pileated woodpecker and the red bellied woodpecker are both in the category of woodpecker birds. Pileated woodpecker seems slightly bigger than the red bellied woodpecker. Both kinds of birds are mostly attached to the tree horizontally. The colors for both birds are the same - they consist of red, black and white.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 162 vs 183 (Canada Warbler vs Northern Waterthrush) (easy)\n",
    "Canada warbler is a tiny, yellow bird with white ring around its eyes, and northern waterthrush is a gray  / brown shade of tiny birds with white/brown dot patterns on their stomach. They’re both small birds with short beaks, and mostly on tree branches (in the images).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 101 vs 053 (White Pelican vs Western Grebe) (medium)\n",
    "White pelican and western grebe are quite similar to each other. Their bodies both have an S-shape with long speculum. However, the speculum of white pelican is proportionally bigger and longer compared to that of western grebe. The clearest distinguishing feature between the birds is their body  color. White pelican is very white, while western grebe has black body, black forehead and white neck.\n",

    "##### 140 vs 139 (Summer Tanager vs Scarlet Tanager) (hard)\n",
    "Both of these birds are dominantly red birds in the Tanager category (easily seen). Both of these birds have small beaks, legs, and body types(easily seen). They both only contain the colors red and black(easily seen). The Scarlet Tanager has completely black wings whereas the Summer Tanager has mainly red wings with a faded black at the end(medium-hard to see). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 70 vs 79 (Green Violetear vs Belted Kingfisher) (easy)\n",
    "These two birds have no colors in common and are in different categories of bird. The Green Violetear is black, blue, purple, and green whereas the Belted Kingfisher is gray, white, and brown(easily seen). Both birds have full black eyes and tend to sit on horizontal branches(medium to see). Both of these birds have smaller body types with narrow and medium length beaks(easy to see).\n",

    "##### 83 vs 15 (White Breasted Kingfisher vs Lazuli Bunting) (easy)\n",
    "Both of these birds have the colors blue and a reddish brown on their tummy(medium to see). But, the White Breasted Kingfisher had a red head and beak and the Lazuli Bunting had a blue head and a black beak. The birds both have medium to small body types and short legs. The Kingfisher is shorter and more round where the Bunting is more long and skinny. \n",

    "#### Discuss the precision and recall scores of each class for your various models. What seems to be your strongest model and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision and recall both showed the overall model performance. We used 0 for the first class, and 1 for the second class. And we consider the precision and recall for each class separately. The best model should have a high precision and recall for both classes and a smaller difference among two classes. All the numbers had been shown in the data frame above. Looking at the overall strength of our models (both folders (0 vs 1)), they look pretty strong due to only one of the models precision and recall scores both being under 0.35, and only two models total with both precision and recall scores below 0.50 each. To start, our weakest model was Model 2 “Model-162vs183”, which has the precision and recall scores for folder (162) at 0.35, and folder (183) at 0.187500. The two birds being looked at are the Canada Warbler vs Northern Waterthrush. The low scores can be because of several different factors and I believe that the main problem the computer had was the spots on the Waterthrushe’s stomach being scattered, and the fact that the birds tend to sit on trees in the opposite directions or even different colored trees. The model with the highest precision and recall scores (combined) in both folder 0 and 1 was model 7 “89vs87”. Folder (89) had the scores 0.85, and folder (87) had the scores 0.80. Because they are both high percentages and they are pretty close to each other, model 7 has our strongest precision and recall scores. This was not surprising to us because both of these birds, the Hooded Merganser and the Mallard, live in water. So, all, if not most of the pictures taken of them are in water.  They have easely distinct differences because their colors are plain and have pretty set cut offs. The mallard has a green head that cuts off all at the same point of the neck. The Merganser has a white and black head but the colors are very neatly assembled. Also, both of these birds have longer and bigger body types with a longer neck and beak. Therefore, we predicted that the differences would be easily seen, and we were right. \n",

    "#### Discuss the results of your novel bird species dataframe. Do the classifier scores for the novel species seem to describe that species in a patterned way? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose Yellowthroat (No. 200) as our novel species to analyze. It is a small size yellow bird, with a long tail. There are 59 birds in the folder, so we use the 10 models for each of them and get a dataframe attached above. Then, we want to understand the overall ability of the prediction, so I calculate the average per column. All the average numbers are around 50%, which matches our assumption, as Yellowthroat did not appear anywhere in our model. It is in a pattern based on the picture similarities. 50% is the natural threshold, which means if we did nothing to the model, the probability that we pick the right one should be 50%, as it is a binary situation. Model 5 gave the best prediction, that the average probability is 52.2%. Model 7 gave the worst prediction, which is 44.5% of probability. Two types of birds in model 5 are both small size birds. And Yellowthroat is small too. One of the birds from the folder is green/blue. In some pictures the color may be yellow, which matches with the Yellowthroat. For model 7, both species belong to the category of Mallard or duck, which is totally different from Yellowthroat, which is a bird on the tree often. Mallard and duck can be found in water for most of the pictures. Thus, the model can not do a good job distinguishing both classes. \n"

    "In this project, we created 10 models that were able to distinguish between two types of birds. Amongst all 10 pairs, we set up the hypothesis for each pair - 4 easy comparisons, 3 medium comparisons, 3 hard comparisons. We ran the model, got the predicted label, and computed the accuracy, precision, and recall scores in order to measure the performance of each model. And we put them into the data frame shown above. The analysis of the data led to many noteworthy results. One thing that we realized was that trying to predict how well the computer would compare the birds was not as easy as we initially thought. Our predictions were off on some of the models and it shows that computers think a lot differently than humans. Some of our hypotheses did not match the results. We think one of the reasons is that the data is very limited. For each model, we only have less than 100 pictures per class put into it. It is a small size for model training. The other reason is that the bird in each image only occupied a small proportion of the overall picture. A lot of other features may be captured and trained, for example environmental factors, whether it is on trees or water may significantly change the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the novel species (No. 200) and put it into our ten models and analyzed the results. As it is a novel species, the accuracy rate is not expected to be high. The results match very well with our hypothesis: all the numbers are around 50%. Some of them work better than others if they have similar bird characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have trained and tested the novel bird species (No. 13) and used ten of our models to predict the novel species’ probability of being in either class. By using 3 different binary classifiers - decision tree, logistic regression, and KNN, we have looked at the model probability scores. Our result told us that the decision tree works the best for the classification process with the highest performance score. The weakness part may becasue of a improper method choices or not large enough for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next step, if we have more data used for training, the model prediction will be more accurate. Also, if we can zoom into bird images more, we may have fewer external factors that affect the performance of the model. \n"
